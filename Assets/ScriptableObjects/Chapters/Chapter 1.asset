  - oh...
  - It's been...
  - 4 days...
  - This is embarrassing..
  - Well it appears you have arrived right on time!
  - You're the new apprentice in search of knowledge.
  - Haha! What else could you be, right?
  - Excuse me! I have yet to introduce myself!
  - I am Xal, guardian of this realm.

  - There are always creatures trying to disrupt the realm.
  - Now, let's leave this crusty place and get you started.
