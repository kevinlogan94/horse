  Quotes:
  - Welcome Back!
  - So...
  - This is a little embarassing...
  - I had something really cool to share with you.
  - But it seems as if it I have nothing to say.
  - As if someone writes out every word I say...
  - And they didn't have the time.
  - But, how could that be?
  - I guess whoever that is better figure it out.
  - Then again, why did they write all this out but not what I'm suppose to say?
  - Better luck next time?
  - Come back later!
